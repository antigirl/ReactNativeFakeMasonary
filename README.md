# ReactNativeFakeMasonary

UPDATE: This was just a mere test, please see https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-native-masonry for a real solution 

Alternative way of compiling a masonary view until react-native officially updates the flex module. 
Its basically 2 views, with flexDirection: 'column' and random height on images.
There is no current way to actually tackle a 'REAL' masonary solution as network images witdh and height is not returned in react-native

use http-server npm module or equivalent to mount the images on assets folder, app is using images from there, http://localhost:8080/female1.jpg
